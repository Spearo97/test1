# Data Science Languages

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

1. **Python:** Widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. It has a large ecosystem of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

2. **R:** Specifically designed for data analysis and statistics. R has a rich collection of packages for statistical modeling and visualization.

3. **SQL:** Essential for working with relational databases. Data scientists often use SQL to query and manipulate data stored in databases.

4. **Julia:** Known for its high-performance computing capabilities, Julia is used in scientific computing and data analysis.

5. **Scala:** Commonly used with Apache Spark for large-scale data processing and analysis.



# Data Science Libraries

Some of the commonly used libraries by Data Scientists include:

1. **NumPy:** A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions.

2. **Pandas:** A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrame for efficient data cleaning, exploration, and transformation.
 
3. **scikit-learn:** A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.

4. **TensorFlow:** An open-source machine learning library developed by Google. It is widely used for building and training deep learning models.

5. **PyTorch:** Another popular deep learning library, especially favored for its dynamic computation graph and ease of use in building neural networks.

### Examples of Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions in Python

In data science and programming, arithmetic expressions play a crucial role in performing mathematical operations. Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:



1. **Addition:**
   ```python
   result = 5 + 3

2. **Subtraction:**= 10 - 4

3. **Division:** = 15 / 3

4. **Multiplication:** = 6 * 2

5. **Exponentiation:** = 2 ** 4


```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
result
```




    17




```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
```
